Notes that were taken while attending Raymond Hettinger's "Python for Engineers II". Needless to say this class has been really, really nice. Thought I knew most of it but clearly I didn't, in any case here it is, feel free to send some PRs to improve the content :)

The 4-day Interactive class covers the the following topics:

1. Review fundamentals with a simple exercise, but paying attention to applying
best practices and having a deep understanding of every step.
2. Demonstrate modern type annotations, demonstrate testing techniques such as
doctest.
3. Learn basic optimizations and how to run timings for performance analysis.
4. Cover the collections module: ChainMap, namedtuple, defaultdict, Counter, deque
    and show common applications for each.
5. Cover argparse and building command line tools.
6. Cover advanced patterns of raising and handling exceptions.
7. Practice skills for methodically building-up complex functions.
    Apply those skills to a distance function and a k-nearest neighbors
    machine learning example
8. Demonstrate techniques for patching bugs in third party code .
9. Cover new-style techniques: classmethods, staticmethods, subclassable repr,
    name mangling for class local references, properties, subclassing techniques
    and use of super(), and speed/space optimizations with __slots__.
10. Cover the logging module and best practices
11. Let to write you own decorators and then apply them to building
      a REST API micro-framework from scratch.  This gives a deep
      understanding of how common Python applications work.
12. Cover the new dataclasses module and show applications.
13. Cover process automation using the subprocess module.
      Apply the skills to building a function that calls Graphviz.
14. Show patterns of how to make multiple constructor signatures
      including how to use single dispatch.
15. Learn f-strings and how to use templating tools.
16. Learn Python's DB-API2 for communicating with databases.
      Run multiple Sqlite3 examples.
17. Cover XML generation and how to combine with other tools.
18. Learn multi-threading including techniques for communication,
      controlling sequencing, guaranteeing mutual exclusion, and
      how to reason through threading complexities to make reliable code.
19. The course culminates in an afternoon writing a website and REST APIs
      using either Bottle or Flask.  This brings together all of the skills
      learned in the class.
